# Customer-Self-Service-Portal
=>  Overview:
  This project is focused on building a Customer Self-Service Portal for the insurance industry using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The portal 
  allows customers to submit insurance claims, track their status, and access assistance via a chatbot integrated with a free third-party 
  API like Dialogflow.. I also had the chance to integrate client-side validation and work with API integrations for chatbot and knowledge 
  base functionalities.

=> scope of work:
      HTML
      CSS
      JS

=> Why this matters:
    In today's digital age, empowering customers to manage their claims with ease not only boosts satisfaction but also streamlines the 
    entire insurance process. This portal serves as a valuable tool for improving operational efficiency and enhancing the customer journey.

=> Key Features:

• Seamless claim submission through a user-friendly form

• Real-time tracking of claim statuses via a dynamic table

• Integrated chatbot support powered by AI (Dialogflow)

• Knowledge base search for instant claim-related assistance
